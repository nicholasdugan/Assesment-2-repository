				<h3><u>Heather Bowden</u></h3>
				<p>
 Student number s3763539.<br><br> I was born in Australia and grew up in Melbourne and Bendigo. My hobbies can change depending on where I am living. But I do like to read crime novels to turn off my brain at night and engage in gardening to relax. I like IT as I find it challenging and it is always changing. My background in IT is that I started in telecommunications and moved into mainframe peripherals, then Netware servers. I then moved into networking with my last position as a senior consultant in a global network engineering team.

						 I was born in Australia and spent much of my life in Warrandyte on the Yarra river however now am living in Fitzroy. My main hobbies are surfing, snowboarding, riding however I also enjoy the more relaxing pleasures of life as I love to read as well as bake. If I am being truthful, IT has never been something I consider myself particularly interested in however this class as an elective has sparked an interest which I would like to grow further. My experience within IT comes mainly from my own business which operates partially on the online market, so this has required me to increase my skills and understanding to best operate my business.

											<h3>Team Profile</h3>
											<h4><u>Heather</u></h4>
											<p>
												<img src="images/HeatherLogistician.png" width=20% height=20%>
												<pre>

According to the Myers-Briggs Test I am:
16personalities.com/profile page
Type “The Logistician” (ISTJ-A)Traits
Introverted - 59%
Observant - 58%
Thinking - 58%
Judging - 79%
Assertive - 57%
Role Sentinel
Strategy Confident Individualism

My Learning Style
The Oxford Learning College test is like a bridge between personaltity and learning styles.
Learning Type Quiz
My results were:
Reflector
Reflectors like to observe from many different perspectives. They collect data, both firsthand and from others,
and prefer to think about it thoroughly before coming to any conclusion. The thorough collection and analysis
of data about experiences is what counts, so they tend to postpone definitive conclusions for as long as possible.
They are thoughtful people who would like to consider all possible angles and implications before making a move.
They prefer to take a back seat in meetings and discussions. They enjoy observing other people in action.
They listen to others and get the drift of the discussion before making their own points.
They tend to adopt a low profile and have a slightly distant, tolerant, unruffled air about them.
When they act it is part of a large picture which includes the past as well as the present and others’
observations as well as their own.
Strengths of a Reflector
• Careful
• Thorough and methodical
• Thoughtful
• Good at listening to others and assimilating information.
• Rarely jump to conclusions

Meyers-Briggs Results
<br>
<img src="images/KobiMeyersBriggs.png" width="680" height="250">
<br>
These results, explain some of my actions a lot better than I would be able to. The results say I am ‘Turbulent Logician’ which means that I am abstract thinking and very enthusiastic with new ideas. According to the results, I am also very private and withdrawn and can be very insensitive at times, both these aspects I do see in my everyday actions and my thoughts. After seeing these results, I definitely believe that I will watch my behaviour when working in teams. I can’t, as a logician, over correct someone and I cannot withdraw from a project.I will also watch who I pick if I do get to pick a team. As a turbulent logician, I would not pick another logician as they do not work well together as they want to work alone. I would want to work with an architect.
<br>
<br>
Big Five Personality Test
<br>
<img src="images/Kobi5Traits.png" width=35% height=35%>
<br>
These results confer with the 2 previous tests. They agree that I am a private, withdrawn person. These results really hammers the nail in the coffin. They show that I am in the lower percentile for conscientiousness and intellect/imagination. They also show that I am high-scoring for agreeableness. All of these result indicate that yes I am a turbulent logician, someone who is happy to agree to stop any conflict and that I am very distant with peers. This gives me something to work on. I do not want to just agree to stop any chance of conflict. I will try and push my ideas more forward. With making groups, I would not get more people who are like me but opposites. So we can move forward with ideas, that are good. If I have a group that are full of turbulent logicians, we would all agree and potentially put forth a bad project/assignment because we were too scared of conflict.
											</p>
											<h4><u>Nicholas</u></h4>
											<p>
The first personality analysis was the Myers-Briggs profile this developed in the early 20th century breaks an individual down into one of 16 different personality types, these break down how we see the world and how we interact with those in it. My personality type is the Campaigner which is a free spirit personality that “are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they make with others. Charming, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd.” This personality type is predominately a curious and an enthusiastic personality that enjoys contact with people however can become hindered by an inability to remain focused as well as poor practical skills.
<br>
<br>
Whereas the Myers-Briggs is to see your overall personality and behaviour traits the learning style test analyses how you best learn though either visual, auditory or tactile means. In my specific case I am both a visual learner at 40% and an auditory learner at 35% with tactile learning making up for 25%. This means I learn best from seeing something done or having it explained to me rather than having to read about it myself furthermore this can mean I am good at visualisation and explaining information to other people however I can be distracted by the outside world.
<br>
<br>
The third and final analysis is the Big Five Personality Test. This provides similar information to that of the Myers-Briggs personality test however rather than categorising you as one particular personality type this breaks your personality down into 5 key groups which are extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness and intellect/imagination. In my case I scored highly on extroversion with 86th score percentile, emotional stability in the 78th and intellect/imagination on 52nd. Where I performed less on is agreeableness and conscientiousness where agreeableness wasn’t that low of a raw score however this lowered with score percentile. What this all means is that I tend to be outgoing and social with a good control over my emotions resulting in less mood swings and outbursts and tend to be more open to new experiences and trying things in unconventional ways. My negative sides are that I tend to be more critical and impulsive or disorganised which can negatively impact my work.</p>

											<img src="images/JoshuaCreativityTest.png" width="580" height "450" style=float:centre;>
											<br>
											<p>
The results of the Meyers-Briggs test don’t shock me and I somewhat agree with its evaluation, but I think that it maybe puts me under “The Logician” because I’m a little bit introverted.
I believe it depends on the mood I am in and the people I’m around that change how I feel about interacting with people. I can work with other with little to no issues,
and I purposefully do not try and “pride” myself on a “vigorous intellect” like the Meyers-Briggs test suggests. I do find myself often   second guessing ideas, thoughts and plans a lot, up until the point of indecision, which can be detrimental when trying to actually get myself out of the house.
The VARK questionnaire also confirmed what I already know, in that I learn the best by reading, writing and gaining experience.
Creativity has never been a strong point with me, and this test confirms that too ranking myself lower than a typical person.
<br>
<br>
These results may influence my behavior in a team as it shows that I like to work alone and rely on evidence and facts before I believe or commit to something.
This would likely make me come off as insensitive if I don’t take into account other people’s views or methods of doing things.
These results also reinforce things I need to work on, like taking charge and leading, and allowing for more creative input into whatever work is being done.
<br>
<br>
It also shows that I need to work on my introversion and try and connect with other people rather than just not making an effort to know other people after work is done.
When forming a team I would need a few people that are similar to me to bounce ideas off and discuss different problems with,
while also keeping creative and leadership type people around to ensure we have a good amount of variety to make the team work efficiently and effectively.
Personally, I would need to make a point of being very open to others ideas and perspectives to ensure the team can allow for variety and that they can properly contribute to the team.</p>

								<h3><u>Ideal Jobs</u></h3>
								<h4><u>Heather</u></h4>
								<p>Cybersecurity Lead – Advisor at AGL

									My “Ideal Job” would be involved in Cybersecurity. This role is a management role that leads a cybersecurity department. This role interested me in that it is not just about the technology, its about interacting with various people including those affected by security not just fellow technical workers. It also attracts me because it is with a high value target from a security point of view, hence the work should be valued and not thought of something just to do, to meet minimum legal requirements. It is a role about implementing processes and education. It is not just about educating the general staff and partners, but also the security staff about how to minimise risk while still allowing the general staff, partners, and customers to be able achieve their goals efficiently.

									The position requires either experience or qualifications (not specified), in risk management, IT and telecommunications security, IT and telecommunications policy. It requires a management background that is corporate and experience as a security consultant.

									I have a corporate network background, working often for financial institutions, hence I have experience of PCI compliance, security audit compliance, security appliances such as web firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), virtual private networks (VPN), hardware security modules (HSM), and application delivery controllers (ADC).

									I am lacking the process skills, after completing a Bachelor of Technology, I am hoping to complete my masters in IT security. From there I may try to gain some certifications such as CRMA and/or CISSP while working in a more junior security role.

									Welcome to AGL Careers - Workday (myworkdayjobs.com) </p>
									<h4><u>Kobi</u></h4>
									<p>This job is for a cyber security analyst at ASIO. This position will have me analysing data on different companies and also the defence department’s current ICT and security systems. It will have me develop strategies to improve security and protection of confidential data. I’ll be monitoring logs and traffic on specific networks to track and report suspicious activity.



The skills, qualifications and experience required for this position are listed in the job description. On the site, it says “While we’re looking for attitude as much as aptitude, to apply you’ll need to: Have completed - or be in the final year of - a degree of technical relevance, such as: software engineering, Cybersecurity, Networking, Containerisation and cloud architecture, ICT, DevSecOps, Mechatronics, Data management, Telecommunications, Program and portfolio managements.”



The skills, qualification and experience I have is limited to only personal experience with coding languages such as HTML, javascript, CSS and C++.



My plan to develop my qualifications and skills and expand my experience is by finishing my course at RMIT and learn more skills as I work. Later in life, I want to do my course and possibly become an ethical hacker. A link to a course is here (https://courses.stationx.net/p/the-complete-ethical-hacking-course-bundle/?coupon_code=CYBERXREGULAR&affcode=58751_ly77iek4). </p>
									<h4><u>Nicholas</u></h4>
									<p>I consider myself a people person with an interest in meeting people and building new relationships hence if I had to find a dream job in tech, combining this skill with a desire to be on the forefront of technology would be something that interests me. Therefore, a dream role would be either a project manager or as a business analysist that gets to work with the client to help improve their processes this would make use of my degree in logistics and supply chain management. Obviously, I would need to increase my skills and understanding of IT however this would allow me to access my skills that I already have or are currently growing and hence would fit well with my capabilities.

											<h4><u>Joshua</u></h4>
											<p>The Cyber Security Analyst role is essentially implementing policies and rules to ensure that this particular company is up to date with their cyber security protocols.
												This job is appealing to me because the Analyst must be continuously motivated and required to learn of the newest threats that could occur to the company and constantly learning how new technologies work.
												In my current workplace, I really enjoy learning about new systems whenever the opportunity arises so I hope to implement this same drive in becoming a Cyber Security Analyst.
												In my current workplace, I have to follow certain rules and regulations set out in regards to the operation, maintenance and security of the equipment we use,
												so I can use this experience and apply it within Cyber security.
												<br>
												<br>
												The qualifications needed for this job are at a tertiary level in computer science, IT or engineering with experience in these roles and in cyber security.
												The skills needed for this position include a lot of knowledge and experience using Amazon Web Services, including their security features such as GuardDuty and Web Application Firewall.
												Also the ability to manage and use in the software Docker is ideal.
												The Analyst must also be competent in communicating technically and non-technically with colleagues and even international firms. As I progress in this degree, my technical and non-technical explanations of topics
												will improve as I continue to learn more and more about the realm of IT. To obtain the specific skills and qualifications listed in the job advertisement,
												I will enroll in AWS courses and at the bare minimum achieve the foundational knowledge of a “Cloud Practitioner” and then further develop my AWS qualifications from there.
