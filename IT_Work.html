				<h2>Report on IT Professionals:</h2>
				<br>
				<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT6NmwGGRWE"><b style="color:blue;">Day in the Life of a Web Designer | Flux</b></a><b> Ran Segall</b></h3>
				<h4><b>What kind of work is performed by the IT professional?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Ryan Segall is a web designer, developer, business owner and youtuber. Predominately he works as a web designer where he works with a team of 2 other website developers to create high end websites for large businesses, normally he takes on 1-2 jobs every quarter which allows him enough time to properly devote to development. As well as this he also works as a youtuber where he teaches people how to improve their skills in web design and also shows people his life working in the field. As a result of being a popular youtuber he also does a lot of promotions such as speeches and events which are targeted towards a tech based market.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>What kind of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they IT professionals, clients, investors or the general public?</b></h4>
				<p>
				As a business owner he has to engage with multiple different groups of people, the main one is clients where he is the first point of contact for all engagements between the clients and his team. He also engages with many different IT professionals as he focuses mainly on web design and in some cases requires help from other professionals with a specific set of skills who can help with a problem that he may be facing with the website. As a result of his youtube channel he has to also deal heavily with the general public in order to generate future sales for his business as well as also keep his channels following strong.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Before the Covid 19 pandemic Ran was working in a shared office space in Tel Aviv this allowed his team to best access high quality facilities for a relatively cheap overall cost. Currently however he has been working from his home office as Israel is under stricter lockdown conditions when compared to Australia.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Ran says that the most difficult part of his job comes when dealing with his clients. As a result of being a small business he has to choose which clients he wants to work with this normally comes from a pool of at least 5 potential businesses. Therefore he has to spend lots of time trying to understand everything about the business and the project in order to make his choice which is fairly time intensive. Furthermore once he has chosen a business because of the cost of the project he has to ensure that the clients are being informed of all relevant details and have to consult them on every choice he makes which although it can be reasonably expected it does distract him from performing his work and this is why he believes it's his most challenging aspect of his business.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<h3><a href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-it-pro-it-manager"><b style="color:blue;">A Day in the Life of an IT Pro: IT Manager</b></a><b> Johnathan Dalia</b></h3>
				<h4><b>What kind of work is performed by the IT professional?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Johnathan works as an IT manager for a medium sized American trucking company therefore he is in charge of all IT related jobs that a present within the business. His primary role is to set up, configure and maintain all data links between the business this can be visual, audio or purely data connections mostly between warehouse locations, customers and with truck drivers out on the road.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>What kind of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they IT professionals, clients, investors or the general public?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Johanthan mainly associates with other IT professionals as he is in charge of the IT department and therfore has to lead and direct the team under him to perform tasks correctly. He is also the first point of contact for all other members of the company if they have an issue that needs resolving so he interacts with clients when there has been a IT issue that needs resolving or explaining to the clients.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</b></h4>
				<p>
				He spends the majority of his time based out of the main office in New Jersey however as his role requires ensuring that all data links are setup and working efficently he will often travel to the businesses 4 other data centers based in Illinois, Texas, south Carolina and Louisiana however this is usually for a short amount of time and the majority of his work is at the main office. With Covid 19 he is able to perform much of his work remotely and only spends a portion of his time in the offices to solve any problems that require a physical presence.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Johnathan states that learning new skills is the most challenging part of his job. He is qualified in Network Communications as well as IT administration and has certificates in various different areas however when entering this role he was required to learn new processes and systems on the fly such as managing and implementing an enterprise resource planning system migrating from a DOS system without any previous experience. Therefore his biggest challenge is implementing new programs and learning the skills to operate them in a time sensitive industry without any outside guidance.

				<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiI1wrw2W2Q"><b style="color:blue;">A Day in the Life of an IT Professional: Oliver Reiter - National CTC</b></a><b> Oliver Reiter</b></h3>
				<h4><b>What kind of work is performed by the IT professional?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Oliver's main role involves meeting with potential clients who are predominately other businesses, governments, schools and not for profits in order to discuss and ascertain their needs for data safety and storage and ensuring that their network environments are protected. After this he helps design a project that will help solve the issues that are present within the organisation and then he is responsible for managing the process of building and implementing the businesses plan.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>What kind of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they IT professionals, clients, investors or the general public?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Oliver deals with most groups throughout his job including other IT professionals both at his work and client side he also has to work closely with clients and spends some time with investors when it is required for new products. Mostly he interacts with clients as it is his job to sell them on new products and help implement them into their businesses so he needs to be with them a lot to help them through the process.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Oliver spends the majority of his time working from the office and spending time on the road working with clients. As a manager for the company he will spend much of his time working at the company office managing the team that works under him as well as being in contact with the rest of the staff. He also will have to spend time on the road meeting with clients to help maintain a good business relationship and help them with any issues they might be having as well he also spends much of his time meeting with new clients to help build a potential sale.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</b></h4>
				<p>
				The part of the job Oliver finds most difficult is dealing with client issues. An example that he gave is when a large government organisation hit a roadblock with their implementation of the companies software which presented such an issue that it was possible that they would have to cancel the partnership and it was Olivers job to assess the issues present and work on a plan to overcome them and get back on track. These issue he often deals with and therefore he can spend a large amount of time having to deal with client issues involving implementation.

				<h3>><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUl3M2vPFKU"><b style="color:blue;">Day In The Life Web Designer - probably not what you think</b></a><b> Kay Cinho</b></h3>
				<h4><b>What kind of work is performed by the IT professional?</b></h4>
				<p>
				As he is a freelance Web Designer most of his work is in designing the web pages for clients, from design elements to the layouts and functionality of the websites. As he is a solo web designer he also does the meetings with the clients, and finds and covers all of their needs for their website. When meeting clients the work is in covering what they need, and providing a layout mock up for them before continuing further.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>What kind of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they IT professionals, clients, investors or the general public?</b></h4>
				<p>
				As Kay works as a solo freelance designer and has no colleagues the people he interacts with are his clients. Outside of client meetings his only other interactions are with the people who have purchased his mentorship (basically offering further teaching for people entering the field) or his consulting for their projects.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Most of his time is spent at home however he will hire out co-working spaces for a change of scenery, or to meet with clients. He usually meets clients at a co-working space if they are from out of town or they do not have an office space, otherwise he will usually go to the clients, meaning he has to factor in travelling as part of his day's schedule which is part of why he tries to put all meetings on the one day.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Kay finds the most challenging part of his job to be finding the correct creative solution for a client. He will sometimes hit a roadblock when he is trying to design a website for the client. To help combat this he makes sure that he spends time in the middle of his day doing something else, often going to the gym which helps refresh his mind. He also finds that on the days he does travelling to meet clients the driving on the roads also help.

				<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DOOeX8sVVc"><b style="color:blue;">A day in the life of a UX Designer in San Francisco (but forreal)</b></a><b> Alexa Herasimchuk</b></h3>
				<h4><b>What kind of work is performed by the IT professional?</b></h4>
				<p>
				As the Product Designer she does a lot of design work for the products. She writes her own project documentation, which can be design files, digital pages or slide demos which lets her refresh what is happening between all the projects and lets her decide what needs to be focused on for the day. Due to the nature of work she has meetings between different groups of designers as well as sessions with the engineer and product manager partners.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>What kind of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they IT professionals, clients, investors or the general public?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Due to the nature of her work the larger majority of people she interacts with are other IT professionals as she has a lot of meetings to make sure everything is going properly. However depending on the phase of a project she might be doing research meetings with customers or internal stakeholders.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Alexa spends most of her time in the office as this is where she has her meetings as well as conducts all of her design work. She will be at different places within the office depending on whether she is meeting specific groups or not. Some of her work is done at home in the morning as she will occasionally take a call there before heading into the office, as with time zones and everything else that can be the most convenient thing.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4><b>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</b></h4>
				<p>
				Alexa finds all the meetings to be the most challenging aspect of her work, as most days have around half the day be meetings, with some days be completely taken up with all the required meetings. For this she is grateful that her work has a dedicated no meeting day as this allows her to focus on the design work. Despite the challenge of the meetings affecting the ability to have design work time she thinks the meetings are incredibly important as they allow everyone to be on the same page for the product to move it forward.
