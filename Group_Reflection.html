						<h2>Overall group reflection </h2>
						<p>
<u>What went well </u>
<br>
As a group we were able to work upon our individual strengths and covered for those who may have a particular weakness in a certain area. Some of our team had very high IT capabilities while others were great organizers and capable report writers, because of this we were able to pick and choose what we believed that we would be good at and focus solely on that.
<br>
<br>
<u>What could be improved </u>
<br>
While our communication by the end of the project was perfect, we did have some difficulties when it came to group planning in the early phases of this project. 2 of our team members were unable to connect with the group and hadn’t used Microsoft teams before this caused at a minimum a 2 week hold up wasting potentially useful time. We also made mistakes when it came to planning out times in which we could have a meeting, and this meant that although our video meetings were successful and allowed for great discussion there would always be 1-2 members who weren’t able to attend.
<br>
<br>
<u>What was surprising: </u>
<br>
The way in which all team members interacted with each other was surprising to all. As a group we come from a wide range of different areas and of different age demographics, yet we were all able to come together and engage in enthusiastic and positive discussions with every member actively volunteering to put in extra work to ensure the best end result. In the last week of the assignment many group members were on their own time getting in contact with other members to check on their progress and see how they were doing and if they needed any help, this is not the usual with many group projects.
<br>
<br>
<u>Something we have learned</u>
<br>
Although it’s not a new idea in the case of this group assignment communication has been key. We have all had many university group assignments in the past where members have been absent, or members have not been performing their fair share of work. In the case of this group, we learnt that at the start of the project the lack of communication was significantly affecting our overall performance however once we started having weekly 1hr video discussions our group performance and moral greatly increased.

							<h2><u>Solomon’s Group Reflection</u></h2>

<u>What went well?</u>
<br>
I think we formed our group quickly which was a vital step. I believe I sent the first message to our group participants on 18 March 2021 and our group had been formed the night before. We started to figure out our communication system soon after that. We all worked fairly evenly towards the project. We were all willing and motivated to get started, allocate work and get our individual pieces done. Each person worked hard to keep up with the group and attend as many meetings as possible. We got the correct number of meetings done, even if a few of us missed a meeting here or there.
<br>
<br>
<u>What could be improved?</u>
<br>
I’m not sure that there was much to be improved. We were a strong group that supported each other where we had flaws or contributed more where we had strengths. We had no areas of conflict and discussed mildly different opinions calmly to come to the most beneficial outcome. Perhaps we could have anticipated differing time zones a bit better but we sorted that out eventually. We did the best we could while learning to use MS Teams without and/much prior experience. Perhaps there were a few areas where we could have met the word counts and didn’t - but I wouldn’t say we are missing much in the way of value, despite the word deficit. I wish I was a little quicker to submit my individual pieces as I did lag for up to a few days here and there but caught up each time without issue. I don’t believe this created an issue amongst the group but it is a good chance for me to improve in this area anyway.
<br>
<br>
<u>At least one thing that was surprising?</u>
<br>
It was surprising how well we did. I expected there to be areas of conflict, lack of support, lack of motivation or other limitations both inside or outside of our control. However, we did really well and I am very proud of what we did.
<br>
<br>
<u>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</u>
<br>
They can work really well. If I’m being honest, I did not have high expectations for the group work but I was blown away with how much work we did, how well we communicated and how ready people were to be a part of the group.
<br>

	<h2><u>Kobi's Group Reflection</u></h2>
	<br>
	From my point of view, we all worked together well as a team. Even from a rocky start, we all pitched in and tried our best into writing and creating a well written assignment. A thing that could be improved is group communication and also organising which part of the assignment we would all do. Another thing to improve on would be writing an agenda and actions document whilst we have the group meetings so in future, we aren’t writing it up after the meeting. A thing that was surprising was how fast we all jumped on board and worked together as a team. No one butted heads and everyone worked really well together. This had me learning that university group assignments are nothing like high school group assignments. This has changed my perception on groupwork and now I enjoy working with other people!
