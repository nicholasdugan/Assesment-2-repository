Reflection of Data
The above data is a good reflection as to our Ideal Jobs skill requirements and the Skill sets that are sought after from job listings. It does not
however denote the skills that each individual will achieve from the study path they are undergoing to achieve their Ideal Jobs. From the above data
we can see as a team we have the Generic Skills covered, with some IT Skills lacking to some in their Ideal Jobs that are covered by others.
Graphic Design was the only real downfall however as stated previously the data above is not a reflection of skills each person would have acquired.
So as a end note the team we have put together THE Magician's Assistants will have no problems conquering any task.

<u>Heather's Ideal Job</u>

Cybersecurity Lead – Advisor at AGL
My “Ideal Job” would be involved in Cybersecurity. This role is a management role that leads a cybersecurity department. This role interested me
in that it is not just about the technology, its about interacting with various people including those affected by security not just fellow technical workers.
It also attracts me because it is with a high value target from a security point of view, hence the work should be valued and not thought of something
just to do, to meet minimum legal requirements. It is a role about implementing processes and education. It is not just about educating the general
staff and partners, but also the security staff about how to minimise risk while still allowing the general staff, partners, and customers to be able
achieve their goals efficiently.
The position requires either experience or qualifications (not specified), in risk management, IT and telecommunications security, IT and telecommunications policy.
It requires a management background that is corporate and experience as a security consultant.
I have a corporate network background, working often for financial institutions, hence I have experience of PCI compliance, security audit compliance,
security appliances such as web firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), virtual private networks (VPN), hardware security modules (HSM), and application
delivery controllers (ADC).
I am lacking the process skills, after completing a Bachelor of Technology, I am hoping to complete my masters in IT security. From there I may try to gain some
certifications such as CRMA and/or CISSP while working in a more junior security role.
Welcome to AGL Careers - Workday (myworkdayjobs.com)
Skills for Job
IT Skills
A recognized security certification such as (Certified Information Security Professional) CISSP.
Experience in IT security – operational such as firewall administration, penetration testing, SEIM administration.
Establishment of environments in secure environments such as PCI or HCISPP.
Experience of management of secure environments including audit and risk analysis.
Knowledge of Unix – as so many security appliances are Unix based.

General Skills
Team management skills, process management skills, ability to talk and present ideas. Be able to impart knowledge – such as Train the trainer certification.

IT Skills
Linux is rated at number 10. A senior security consultant is listed at 120. Many of the skills are not listed at all.
Information security is listed at 74. Network security at 144. Process improvement at 104.

General Skills
Communication skills is listed as number 1. Team work/collaboration at number 6. Detail-Orientated at number 9. Presenting skills at number 16.

Has my opinion changed?
No this is an area that really interests me and I already have some base skills and experience in security. I would never embark on a job that I didn't
like or found boring as work is so much of your life. I am not sure if burning glass has not captured the needed skills or if they rank so low they are
not captured. It could be because the skills have many names and have not been grouped together.

Nicholas Dream Job

I consider myself a people person with an interest in meeting people and building new relationships hence if I had to find a dream job in tech, combining
this skill with a desire to be on the forefront of technology would be something that interests me. Therefore, a dream role would be either a project
manager or as a business analysist that gets to work with the client to help improve their processes this would make use of my degree in logistics
and supply chain management. Obviously, I would need to increase my skills and understanding of IT however this would allow me to access my skills
that I already have or are currently growing and hence would fit well with my capabilities.

<u>David's Ideal Job</u>

What is my ideal job?
https://www.hcalawyers.com.au/careers/current-available-position-i-t-systems-and-network-administrator/



This job is for an IT Systems and Network Administrator. The position is about providing the IT systems required for the business, from what the
clients interface with to what the internal teams use and what they require. It would also be maintaining their servers and network. I find the
idea of maintenance as well as providing solutions for any problems if they arise, or changing systems as required for the job an appealing application of my skill in IT.
The position asks for a Bachelor Degree or Diploma in IT Communications as the preferred degree/diploma but not as a requirement, as well as having
a background within the field.
Skills that the position requires:
•	Experience in systems and network administration
•	Skill with Microsoft Windows Server administration
•	Knowledge and experience with important networking and systems concepts
•	Experience with virtualisation servers
•	Development of a Standard Operating Environment and the deployment of software within that
•	Proficiency with Microsoft Office Products
•	Desktop Publishing in a domain environment and experience with server platforms
•	Knowledge of internet technical protocols (e.g. HTML, JavaScript, EML, web publishing and database structure)
•	Knowledge of Android and IOS products
•	Experience with setting up Surface books and Surface notebooks, with both a windows and android operating system
Skills that I already have:
•	Basic knowledge of some of the networking and systems concepts
•	Proficiency with Microsoft Office Products
•	Basic knowledge of internet technical protocols
•	Basic knowledge of Android and IOS products
My plan for gaining the skills required is to continue learning through my current degree and then finding a job for more basic position in a IT Team
for a business to gain skills as a team member. If there is a specific hole in my skills after doing that, or I need further teaching I
would look at doing a more specialised degree while continuing to work in the field.
Skills for Job

General Skills
•	Communication
•	Problem Solving
•	Time Management

IT Skills
Due to the listing of the IT skills it is dificult to directly relate all of it however knowledge of JavaScript is listed as 2 on the IT skills
and is listed in the examples for internet technical protocols. As a lot of this job is related to knowledge around providing solutions Tehcnical
Support (listed at 11) along with Customer Service (14) and Software Engineering (15) would be useful. The rest is knowledge of Windows (4)
and Microsoft Office (18). iOS is not listed on the skills and it's difficult to translate the rest as well.
General Skills
Communication Skills is listed as 1 on the Burning Glass Data. And as it is the job to talk with the different teams to establish what they need
this would be vital. Problem Solving is listed at 2 and it feeds into the idea of working with the other teams to create solutions.
Time Management is listed at 12 and would be important for creating the solutions in a timely manner.
Has my opinion changed?
The Burning Glass data hasn't changed my opinion on the job. It has just highlighted the importance of certain skills within the industry as a
whole, and that having a number of the skills for this position would also be useful for jobs elsewhere within the IT Industry.

•	Joshua's Ideal Job

<u>Cyber Security Analyst</u>


The Cyber Security Analyst role is essentially implementing policies and rules to ensure that this particular company is up to date
with their cyber security protocols. This job is appealing to me because the Analyst must be continuously motivated and required to
learn of the newest threats that could occur to the company and constantly learning how new technologies work. In my current workplace,
I really enjoy learning about new systems whenever the opportunity arises so I hope to implement this same drive in becoming a Cyber Security Analyst.
In my current workplace, I have to follow certain rules and regulations set out in regards to the operation, maintenance and
security of the equipment we use, so I can use this experience and apply it within Cyber security.

IT Skills and Skills for Job
The qualifications needed for this job are at a tertiary level in computer science, IT or engineering with experience in these roles
and in cyber security. The skills needed for this position include a lot of knowledge and experience using Amazon Web Services,
including their security features such as Guard Duty and Web Application Firewall. Also the ability to manage and use in the software
Docker is ideal. The Analyst must also be competent in communicating technically and non-technically with colleagues and even international
firms. As I progress in this degree, my technical and non-technical explanations of topics will improve as I continue to learn more and
more about the realm of IT. To obtain the specific skills and qualifications listed in the job advertisement, I will enrol in AWS courses
and at the bare minimum achieve the foundational knowledge of a “Cloud Practitioner” and then further develop my AWS qualifications
from there.
Another set of skills needed will be to learn how to confidently use Docker containers, this can be done by my own research or by
following a pre made course by a company that teaches it. A good example of this is “A Cloud Guru”, which can teach both AWS and Docker at a cost to me.
I should take these courses and eventually the AWS exam at any time over the next 4 years while completing my degree.

Has my opinion changed?
The burning glass data has not changed my opinion on my ideal job, it has only shown me that I would probably need to learn or
become acquainted with more programming languages.
