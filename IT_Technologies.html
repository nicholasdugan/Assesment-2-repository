				<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2> <br>
				<b><u>What technological or other developments make this possible?</u></b>
				<p>
					Autonomous vehicles are around now, the first autonomous vehicle was created by Nissan in 2013 and the first registered AV was created by Hyundai in 2016. Cruise control is a form of autonomous vehicle. In the next 3 years, more vehicles will be ‘more’ automated and have little to no human input.

					Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, robo cars, driverless cars, etc. are cars that have none, or limited, human input. AVs rely on artificial intelligence (AI), sensors and big data to analyze information, adapt to changing circumstances and handle complex situations as a substitute for human judgement, as the latter would no longer be needed for conventional vehicle operations such as lane-changing, parking, collision avoidance and braking (Long, Hanford, Janrathitikarn, Sinsley, & Miller, 2007; West, 2016). Autonomous vehicles are in demand and have been for a long time. Since late 2009, early 2010, companies like Google and Waymo have been experimenting with autonomous vehicles. They were the first companies to introduce ‘front-crash prevention systems’ that use sensors that warn drivers of an impending obstacle and apply the brakes if the driver does not react fast enough. Waymo also uses high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging) (How Google's Self-Driving Car Will Change Everything, 2021). Lidar uses laser beams to detect objects. Lidar SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) in 3D and Outdoor Visual Navigation (cameras) use algorithms to negotiate other vehicles and the public, this is combined by AI software called Navigation-technology Sensor fusion (Gardens by the Bay 2015).
					<br>
					<br>
					Using SLAM, a vehicle can create a map as it travels down the road and detect obstacles in real time. It allows the vehicle to calculate where it is and how it is moving (mathworks 2021).
					<br>
					<img src="images/Occupancy_Map.png">
					<br>
					Outdoor Navigation systems utilize dual cameras for 3D imagery, the cameras are set apart and use triangulation for the detection of the position of objects as well as their speed. It can also use Time of Flight( ToF) cameras to  measure the speed of light to make decisions. It records information in a single shot – creating the information rapidly in a pixel format. These 3D cameras perform poorly in low light (Future Markets Magazine). Other positioning and object detection technologies are also used depending on the weather, speed and density of objects including Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), radar, sonar and GPS. Modified traffic signs and signaling are also used. It is the Sensor fusion software that creates a smooth traversal and decides whether the Lidar laser system or the Outdoor Visual Navigation system is the system on which to use as input information. The development of these algorithms and advances in camera lenses has increased the preciseness that vehicles can operate in.

					Artificial intelligence is also being used to enable vehicles to identify and deal with adverse weather conditions such as torrential rain, there is currently limitations being able to operate in rain conditions past 30mm /h and deterioration in operation past 10mm /h (Land Transport Guru). It also will be used so that the vehicle can identify a hailing passenger (Ng, 2020).

					The costs of all this technology will limit it’s use in the near future for private vehicles. But for public transport namely buses, there are already commercial vehicles in production such as Volvo’s 7900 electric bus. Trials and some fledgling services are starting to happen around the world. Trial autonomous bus services have been launched in Singapore in two industrial parks, which are the first in the country to be a variable price on demand service, there are also street sweepers operating at night in the west of the country (Jakarta Post 2021).
					<br>
					<br>
					<u><b>What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how?</u></b>
					<br>
					<br>
					With driverless cars, many people will be out of jobs. Bus drivers, ride share drivers, taxi drivers, food delivery drivers and many more job sectors will be impacted with the introduction of driverless cars. Another impact would be the decline of privately owned vehicles. This could result in less pollution and also make driverless cars cheaper. It would also make transportation for disabled and elderly people easier as human input is negated. Another way that emissions would be lowered is that self-driving cars will be practicing more eco-friendly driving patterns. If they practice this efficient driving behavior, they could reduce “unnecessary emissions up to 20%” (How Google's Self-Driving Car Will Change Everything, 2021).
					<br>
					High density cities such as Singapore envisage autonomous vehicles providing last mile public transport reducing the need for private cars and freeing up land resources dedicated to cars for other uses (LTA Singapore 2020).
					<br>
					Insurance is likely to be cheaper as “driver error” accidents are less likely to occur. Hospital trauma centers and recuperative therapy businesses will no longer have business from injuries resulted from traffic accidents. As cars become more automated, they will be less likely to break the law (I am sure car enthusiasts will create work arounds!), this will reduce the need for traffic police and compliance devices such as speed/red light cameras and speed humps. New types of intersections will emerge as autonomous vehicles in the future will be able to collaborate on the most effective way to move around each other, not like current intersections which as designed on rules people on the most part can negotiate.
					<br>
					Support services will be created to keep cars compliant to the latest software and technology levels for safe interaction with roadside systems and other cars. Security systems will also need to be developed to now not only keep out physical thieves but malicious software.
					<br>
					<u><b>How will this affect myself?</b></u>
					<br>
					<br>
					Honestly, in my daily life this will not affect me too much as I probably won’t be able to afford an autonomous car for a long time. In daily life, my actions will not change around cars as autonomous cars are supposed to be safer than cars with human drivers. But in the future, we will be pressured to purchase an autonomous car as governments will be encouraging people to buy autonomous cars to reduce pressure on the health system and insurance costs on regular vehicles will rise as they become less common.
					<br>


					<u><b>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</u></b>
					<br>
					<br>
					My family and friends will be safer. These cars will not get high, drunk, drive recklessly or take unnecessary risks. Over 90% of motor vehicle accidents are caused by driver error (How Google's Self-Driving Car Will Change Everything, 2021). My older relatives may be able to remain independent longer if they could use an autonomous vehicle when they get to the point, they are no longer able to hold a driver’s license. My frail relatives may go out more as they will not have to hire a cab and they will not have to walk far as they will be able to be dropped off at the door of where they want to go and then the car can not only go store itself, but it can then come back to the door when required. We will have more time – we can send the car by itself to be washed or serviced or registered, it can ferry the kids to where they want to go. We will not have to take it ourselves!

				<h2>Cyber Security</h2>
				<p>
					Cybersecurity is the increasingly important subject of safeguarding computer data against malicious or outsider threats. Everybody is affected by cybersecurity, as nearly all governments, organizations and individuals rely on IT systems and the data it contains. By implementing policies and protocols within IT networks and educating employees on common methods of cyber-attack, cybersecurity professionals work to safeguard their organizations data. Cybersecurity covers a broad area of techniques and counter measures to prevent malicious users or organizations from penetrating their systems. Common cybersecurity techniques include Network Security, Data Loss Prevention, Intrusion Detection Systems/Intrusion Prevention Systems and anti-virus/anti-malware software (Forcepoint, 2021). One of the most cutting edge and emerging security techniques is called “Deception Technology”, which creates lures and traps in data that looks legitimate to deceive an intruder into accessing that data, which can generate an alert or warning for the cybersecurity professional or administrator(s) of that network. The data that the intruder is trying to access is commonly imitating legitimate data, hence “deceiving” the intruder. Originally the idea of this came from the “Honeypot” technique, which also mimics a legitimate computer system that likely has valuable information (Symanovich, 2020), and has since morphed into deceptive technology by using multiple honeypots all throughout the network.
					<br>
					<img src="images/CyberSecurityFigure1.png">
					<br>
					<br>
					This technique can provide real-time threat reporting, rather than the intruder gaining access and responders only finding out after significant damage is done, which can cost organizations millions of dollars in lost data and productivity. In the Mandiant Security Effectiveness Report 2020, it was found that 53% of cyber-attacks in businesses included in the report were missed, and only 33% were prevented by already implemented security controls (FireEye Incorporated, 2020). Introducing deceptive technology may eventually be the most common way to detect intruders making their way into different networks. Rather than working on keeping malicious threats out of systems, corporations and government may need to instead work on encrypting all of their data, and make it impossible or highly unlikely for cybercriminals to decipher this data by keeping the encryption keys distributed(Lemos, n.d.). Encrypting a whole organizations data may be a costly and time inefficient strategy, so potentially this may only be open to businesses and governments that can afford that kind of technology. The future of cybersecurity may be in the hands of Artificial Intelligence according to Cybersecurity Researcher Attila Tomaschek. “The future of cybersecurity will have a heavy focus on using artificial intelligence (AI) to secure devices and systems in the increasingly connected world”, says Tomaschek in an article with Disruptor Daily. Using “Human oversight” is drastically ineffective and resource consuming, whereas having an AI system that can analyze and neutralize these threats automatically can help take the workload off human resources. AI can be utilized to consume massive amount of data from all different types of sources, with machine learning the AI can be fully aware of all the different types of risks and threats out on the web. Legacy cybersecurity technologies are unable to keep up with the immense number of threats that organizations and governments face every day, whereas AI systems can provide cybersecurity professionals with the analytics and information to keep them informed to make the right decisions during cyber breaches. The very nature of cybersecurity is one of constant change and of constant catch-up with cyber threats, so technologies like AI and deception will be of ongoing use in the future.
					<br>
					<br>
					The impact of using Artificial Intelligence within cybersecurity will see the automation of highly repetitive tasks that are likely done by cybersecurity professionals already, freeing up their time for other critical tasks. AI can also use its knowledge of previous intrusions and cyber-attacks to scan through data and detect patterns to then allow cybersecurity professionals to make informed decisions about the current threats that could plague their organization. Because of this technology, cybersecurity teams would likely have more time and resources to use on more demanding tasks and with 51 percent of organizations reporting to a have a shortage of cyber security skills in 2017 and 70 percent of Information Systems Security Association members believing that their organization had been impacted by a global shortage in cybersecurity skills (Oltsik J, 2020). This massive understaffing and shortage of cybersecurity skill has led to high burnout rates and puts more pressure on current staff to perform. The understaffing of the cyber industry is cause for alarm, as the professionals that consumers, businesses and governments put their trust in to safeguard our data against malicious threats are being overworked and are burning out, so more emphasis needs to be placed on filling these roles, from primary school to university. In Australia, coding classes have become mandatory in Queensland as the government looks to fill the IT skills gap within many industries and this will likely lead on to the development of more cybersecurity professionals. Using AI within cybersecurity will likely allow staff to use their time efficiently and more effectively respond to cyber threats.
					<br>
					<br>
					Increased use of AI in cybersecurity would affect me by safeguarding my data better and ensuring that my own personal details are not leaked onto the web. If all my data was leaked, a lot of sensitive information about my home location, the places I run and work out in, my regular movements and work conversations would be at risk, which could be a major security hazard considering the Defence institution I work in. Keeping my data and information safe would allow me to continue to work effectively and efficiently day to day, so nothing would change besides reaping the benefits of increased security. In regards to my family’s data, my parents upload all of our childhood photos and videos onto a shared Google Photo account, so keeping that data safe is imperative for my parent’s memories of their children growing up and experiencing life. Besides this, I don’t see AI in cybersecurity, or cybersecurity as a whole, directly affecting my family and friends as most of them do not think about the repercussions of leaked or compromised data, or the ways to mitigate this. They will only experience the consequences of when this happens to them, whether individually or in their workplace. Profits lost due to cyber-attacks are costing organizations in Australia $29 billion per year, but I do not see this amount coming out of the wages from my friends and family, just the company itself who will foot the bill (Das, 2018). This may however have the side effect of causing small to medium businesses to shut down, costing jobs and livelihoods.

						<h2>Robots</h2>
						<p>

							A robot is a machine that is controlled internally or a machine that is designed to accomplish a task and uses programs to make decisions. There are a large range of different types of robots.
							<br>
							<br>
							Nano robots are to be used in medicine and are currently being tested on animals. These can carry medicines to specific places in the body for things such as cancer treatment. Testing at this moment, has mice being treated for brain tumours. In the future it is envisioned that nano or micro robots could be injected into the blood stream and carry out maintenance such as plaque removal.
							<br>
							<br>
							New to medicine are miniature robots called Vivo robots, which are inserted by a small incision into the torso cavity and can be controlled remotely by experienced surgeons. These robots are inexpensive and are transportable and so can be used by less trained staff in remote locations. They also have the advantage of providing scarless surgery.
							<br>
							<br>
							Small robots are being used for colonoscopy procedures, these imitate worms in their movement and greatly reduce the surgical risk of the procedure for example: causing a perforation of the bowel. As these devices can move themselves, they do not need to be pushed into position.
							<br>
							<br>

							Larger robots are being used for camera positions and holding instruments in place. Currently the restrictions on more robotics in medicine is limited by the lack of dexterity of a robot and the lack of a sense of touch (Thomas 2021).
							<br>
							<br>
							Swarm robots or UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) drones are currently in use, mainly for advertising or public displays such as New Year’s Eve celebrations. The number of robots in these displays and their complexity is constantly increasing. Recently Korean car manufacturer Genesis flew 3,218 drones in Shanghai to mark their entry into the Chinese market.
							<br>
							<br>
							(67) GENESIS BRAND NIGHT | GENESIS - YouTube
							<br>
							<br>
							In the future it is hoped to use this technology in more serious deployments such as to replace bees in agricultural pollination and for disaster deployments such as sandbagging.
							<br>
							<br>
							Therapy robots – for example robot therapy dogs for people who cannot look after a real dog or for people who would not be able to cope with the eventual death of their living therapy dog. These are available now from Tombot ($AUS525) Tombot | Robotic Emotional Support Animals – Tombot, Inc. Currently this is an interactive but non-mobile robot.
							<br>
							<br>
							Assistant robots – basically have a base application of Alexa or Google Assistant with sensors. Now, you can get these on wheels such as Temi ($AUS7500) temi - The Personal Robot (robotemi.com), and these can operate as home care monitoring, mobile security monitoring or retail assistants. They cannot perform tasks that require physical manipulation of objects or traverse non flat surfaces.
							<br>
							<br>
							Home appliance robots – robots that perform a single task, apart from floor cleaners, there is Droplet ($AUS400 per head) Droplet | Home (smartdroplet.com), a sprinkler that takes in weather forecasts, soil type and plant types to traverse the garden and fill individual plant water needs. Moley($AUS450,000) Moley Robotics > The world's first robotic kitchen,  a robotic chef that mimics chef Tim Anderson and preps, cooks, keeps pantry inventory and cleans up. Although for the price you could probably afford a real chef.
							<br>
							<br>
							Industrial robots or Cobots have been around for a long time. The current trend is to make them do more than one specific task. They are used on production lines performing repetitive tasks. As robots become cheaper and can learn new tasks this means the robot can be in more adaptable environments as it is now easy to remove a robot and place it on a different production line. This means the task can be for a production run that does not have to completely pay for the robot and make a profit. As the next task can continue to recoup the robots outlay. The lower price and that now robots can now learn a task means that these robots are now found outside of manufacturing such as agriculture, logistics and service sector(Vavra 2020). An example of this would be cocktail making robots such as Toni ($AUS145,000) Makr Shakr – Your drink with a splash of robotics.
							<br>
							<br>
							They are also being used in more dangerous situations such as mining – space exploration research is developing technology that is being redeployed in hostile industrial environments.
							<br>
							<br>
							Soon, we can look at the progression of robots by looking at recent advancements. The current main technology advances are in software allowing for 3D vision which increases precision and improvements in self learning. Mechanically robots are becoming stronger for size. Cobots can now lift 16 kilograms and large robots can lift a tonne(Owen-Hill 2019). Robots can now be created in soft, malleable materials making them skin like and safer in surgery. As robots cover many science fields there is now some interesting collaborations. Jennie the therapy dog was made possible with collaboration between a traditional Cobot manufacturer and Jim Henson’s Creature Shop.
							<br>
							<br>
							The vision improvements of robots are being looked at in agriculture and manufacturing for quality assurance. The vision improvements also mean that logistical storeroom “picker” robots will soon be on the market. These robots will replace people on packing online orders for delivery, further improving the cost advantage of online stores over bricks and mortar stores. It will also reduce costs and in the long term improve a company’s image, as Pickers normally have a high turnover rate and often complain publicly about working conditions (Beiler 2021).
							<br>
							<br>
							In the hazardous environment area, robots are currently being tested for use in abandoned mines.
							<br>
							<br>
							Not only are these robots traversing water and gas filled environments, but it is envisaged they will also be mapping the current state of the mine and sampling the mine for minerals such as rare earth elements. This will be a safer and possibly the only way to determine whether mines can be reworked, hence reducing the impact on the environment by reducing the need for exploration and development of greenfield sites.
							<br>
							<br>
							Soon, I do not think I will see much impact. My work currently, does not look like being replaced by a robot. Any profits made by companies by replacing workers with humans will probably go to shareholders and not to reduce the price of the item on the shelf.
							<br>
							<br>
							Hopefully, I will not need any surgery, but I do hope robots are successful in treating brain tumours as it currently has such a poor outcome for people who are diagnosed with such cancers. I can see people being able to have surgery at country hospitals and not have to travel to city centres for treatment.
							<br>
							<br>
							The main impact maybe the price of food. If farm workers are replaced by robots, where there is a current workforce shortfall. Robots can work longer and more consistently than farm workers – meaning food could be fresher. Farmers would not be limited to growing food only where they can attract labourers. The downside to this would be local towns would not gain the economic influx of the incomes of farm workers. Crops that are currently easy to machine harvest or can only be handpicked may be replaced by more lucrative crops that can be robot picked.
							<br>
							<br>
							I do not envisage that there will be physical robotic home helpers soon. Until robots can traverse stairs or climb ladders, their lack of mobility will limit their usefulness. Although in aged and disabled care exoskeletons and patient lift and support robots such as ROBEAR($AUS330,000) The strong robot with the gentle touch | RIKEN, are starting to make a presence.

								<h2>Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency</h2>
								<p>
								<u><b>What does it do?</u></b>
<br>
A cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency. Bitcoin is the most popular one. It does not physically exist; it only has a digital presence. They are heavily encrypted; they differ to credit cards as they are not tied to financial institutions – it is a peer-to-peer transaction between two parties. You carry your digital currency in a digital wallet.  It is cheaper and faster than credit cards as it takes minutes to clear, not a few days (techtarget).
<br>
<img src="images/What_is_blockchain.png" width=75% height=75%>
<br>
A digital wallet can be used for financial transactions other than a cryptocurrency. Digital wallets can also be used to store credit cards for transaction payment methods such as PayPal or Apple Pay. These work by replacing a credit card number with a tokenized Device Primary Account Number. These still have the back-end credit card processing delay (corporate finance institute).
<br>
Blockchain is an open ledger in the public domain that can be viewed by anyone. All transactions are their displaying what digital wallets transferred digital currency to which digital currency.
<br>
The identity of the digital wallet is encrypted. Currently there is no legislation or regulations around it. Governments are hence promoting digital wallets using digital players such as Apple while they grapple with regulatory control while admitting to the security advantages of digital wallets.
<br>
<br>
Blockchain is a type of database used by some cryptocurrencies to create a ledger. Blockchains store data in blocks and chain them together – hence the imaginative name. It can be used in other circumstances as a database other than just for cryptocurrencies. The data stored is irreversible – hence the ledger of transactions is permanent. Hence currencies cannot be reused making it secure against fraud. A block is a chunk of storage into which data is stored it has a finite space. When filled the block becomes non writable and it added to the chain with a timestamp. This then documents when transactions occurred. Blockchain can operate in a non-centralised manner, what this means is that multiple copies of the database are stored on servers or clusters of servers called ‘node’. Each node has a copy of every transaction that ever occurred in the blockchain. Nodes verify the legitimacy of their database with each other – in order to modify the database, the majority of nodes must agree. To be able to verify each other the ledger is transparent. Which is why the ledger can be publicly viewed, the wallet details are encrypted not the transaction. The blocks order is secured with a timestamp and a hash along with the hash of the block before it.  To edit the block means the hash would change and hence the “chain” would be broken, and that node would become untrusted (Conway, L. 2020).

Cryptocurrencies have advantages by being extremely secure, but this has drawbacks as millions have been lost when passwords to digital wallets have been lost. It is believed that 20% of Bitcoin is idle (not engaged in transactions) and is probably due to lost passwords or the death of its owners.
Its secure and secretive nature has appealed to criminals in transferring funds discreetly, as Bitcoin does not need to know the identity of the owner unlike having a bank account. Being peer to peer means that people do not have the resources like banks to secure their encryption keys and the digital wallets have become the target of thieves for these keys. Banks store their keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM) a device that has no connection to the digital world. These are made by high grade security firms such as Thales (Thales).Another issue with cryptocurrencies is the dependency on data mining. This is energy intensive and hence not good for the environment or for the local infrastructure. It also will limit on how many transactions per second can be obtained. This was famously outlined in what happened in Iceland with the runaway success of their datacentres (Noack, Rick. 2018).

<u><b>What is the likely impact?</u></b>
<br>
This is difficult to say as it depends on how governments regulate the industry. At the moment it seems to be mainly for transferring large amounts of money across international borders and for investment speculation. It is envisaged that the number of cryptocurrencies available will reduce and that the industry will become more regulated.
There are starting to be services such as decentralised finance (Defi) and digital wallet companies such as PayPal have announced they will soon accept cryptocurrencies. Associated technologies such as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) allow for the token to actually represent something – e.g.  video game add-ons, think   CryptoKitties the blockchain game (CoinPedia, 2021).  NFTs have allowed for the rise of digital art by creating a non-refutable copywrite and ownership ledger digital art sales have increased dramatically in volume and value. This may more into more common objects of copywrite such as music, books, and software.
Crypto currencies domestically it still has some issues with its volatile value or share-like behaviour for people to place all their earnings in it. It also has the issue of what do you do if you lose access to your digital wallet?

The travel industry is a prime contender of cryptocurrencies. It would be similar to the old traveller’s cheques where major purchases of hotels tours and fights could be conducted across currencies without the transaction fees. This would have appeal too for the industry as it is a low yield market and the investment in the currency may be more profitable.

Jobs –It will reduce the need for hard currencies – hence less transportation and handling of cash to buildings. It is supposed to be cheaper hence it may affect the data base administrators of traditional ledgers, but it is CPU intensive so infrastructure staff will be in demand to build more data centres. Will there be associated services to keep your digital wallet secure, so you do not lose it or access to it.

<u><b>How will this affect you?</u></b>
<br>
In my daily life, I have started to see a strong following of trading and investing within different crypto currencies that utilize block chain technology. One of the most unique crypto currencies I see gaining a lot of traction is “Dogecoin” which has reached a market cap of $50 billion dollars, increasing 600% in the last two weeks, which is staggering considering the currency was started as a joke aimed at the more popular Bitcoin (Brown, A 2021; Ostroff, C 2021). Trading exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have profited in the rise in popularity in trading alternatives to Bitcoin, where they charge a small fee so that anyone with a phone and a bank account can buy and sell various crypto currencies, and because of the high volatility within these currencies, lofty profits can be made. I have seen in my own social media use of my friends showing off how they trade crypto currency and encourage others to join, but I am still skeptical on its uses besides just another currency to use along with the Australian Dollar. I am yet to see my family use block chain or crypto currency for the sole purpose of a decentralized digital currency, but I am sure they have heard of how (in simple terms) it works. I would warn my family and friends to be cautious in trading or using these highly volatile currencies, as they may end up losing a lot of money.
