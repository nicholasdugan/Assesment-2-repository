						Project Idea  
<br>
<br>

Our idea is to create a touchscreen mirror that recognises you from face id and/or touch id. It would be able to connect and control lights and other Bluetooth connected devices using google home or amazon Alexa. This makes it easier for people who are disabled or have a disability.  For this project we will be aiming at applications to use in the bathroom.
<br>
<br>
 

Motivation:  
<br>

The motivation behind this device is that one member of the team has already have made a basic touchscreen mirror but there is definitely more room to improve. Also, currently touchscreen mirrors that are in production and available to buy to the public are very expensive when the basic software needed for it is very cheap and could be sold to the target audience at a cheap price. 4 million Australians, or 18% of the population (People with disability in Australia 2019: in brief, how many people have disability? - Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2021), have a disability which means the demographic for this device is immense. This device would help people complete tasks that are a struggle for them, the tasks that we take for granted.  It could also be used to prevent falls as falls happen to on in three people over the age of 65 in Australia (Health Direct, unknown).
<br>
<br>
Many of the applications that would help the elderly are not very geriatric user friendly. Many elderly people have sight and hearing issues. Bathrooms which are a high-risk area for the elderly, are places where you do not wear glasses or hearing aids because of moisture and humidity. This means that smart phone applications are of little use to this age group. A Smart Mirror would have dual use and be able to operate at a size many people could read as well as respond to audio commands.
<br>
<br>
 

Description: With the use of raspberry pi technology, the use of this software is enormous. We could keep it basic with showing a makeup video while you do your own makeup. Or we could make it super advanced and have the mirror detect if you have fallen and alert an ambulance or a doctor or a family member/friend. We could have a basic model be able to use Google Assistant/Amazon Alexa capabilities and be able to control music and volume, be able to turn lights off and on, and much, much more. We would have it be able to tell you the weather, tell you any meetings or appointments you had in the afternoon, remind you that you have not drunk enough water. We would have it remind me all the assignments that I have upcoming in Canvas. Informational displays could be developed, to present NASA’s image of the day, so even the astrologists can stay up to date. Of course, you cannot walk past the most important feature of a smart mirror, showing you your beautiful face! Obviously, it would use Raspberry Pi ‘s Raspbian OS(Linux), and Magic Mirror software.
<br>
<br>
Modules we could create for the elderly include:
<br>

 – a check list before stepping into the shower or bath (to limit walking in the bathroom and distributing water to collect forgotten items). This could be created in HTML/CSS and depending on the list length and size of mirror, it would be displayed in groups of items that have been pre-selected to display in an easy-to-read large font of high contrast (Six. J, 2010). The user would then mark off the list, and these items would disappear to be replaced with other items if the list were long, or the mirror is small.
 <br>
 <br>
Medication functions
<br>
<br>
Medication inventory tracker. The owner of the medication would enter the amount of medication they have received from the pharmacist. It would them keep track of how many tablets are used per day and alert if any are getting low in stock. This could be variable such as reminding the owner so many days from when they are about to run out. There could also be a script renewal tracker as well to alert the owner that not only that they need more medication, but they need to visit the doctor as well. This could trigger an earlier reminder giving the owner more time to make an appointment with their doctor.
<br>
<br>
Medication dosage tracker – this tells the user when to take their medication everyday and how much – this could be the same every day or it could be of a pattern over a set number of days. The mirror would need a calendar and time function to keep track of this. Another could be for things such as type 2 diabetes where the user puts in their blood sugar result and the mirror responds with the correct dosage. This would require the user to set up a result – dosage table.
<br>
<br>
The setup could be done with a questionnaire it would ask the owner to put in a drug and then ask if the drug is taken at the same amount every day etc. If inventory has flagged a script renewal. The setup will rerun again to ensure if the drug is still needed and if it is still taken the same way.
<br>
<br>
This would need a Linux virtual onscreen keyboard to provide this functionality.
<br>
<br>
The medication tracker will need facial recognition to prevent tampering.
<br>
<br>
 Noise (voice?) recognition of the shower running to keep track of how long is being spent in the shower for budget reasons – money is precious to pensioners.
 <br>
 <br>
Auto lights on for those midnight trips to the bathroom.
<br>
<br>
If something has fallen on the floor detection and notification. A person with limited hearing or sight may not notice something has fallen and this could become a trip hazard.

<br>
<br>

After a couple months (maybe a few years), we could create node.js wrappers that would create an Apple iOS version of the software and use that connect to Apple HomePod or HomePod mini, which in turn would connect to iPhones and Apple Watches. This would be able to create a more dynamic, seamless use of the technology and would open more possibilities. we could create API’s and modules to connect to the health app and make health tracking much more accurate, such as integration with stroke detection applications such as Fatal Recognition (Lovely Mobile News, 2019).
<br>
<br>


Tools and Technologies:  
<br>

To make this ‘smart’ mirror, we will need basic woodworking tools: drill, saw, file, chisel, tape measure, levels, hammers, squares, wood working pencils and wood glue. We will also need basic software tools: mouse and keyboard, Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi case, micro to HDMI cord, USB c cable, monitor, two-way mirror, IR touch panel or touch foil. For software, open-source projects like MagicMirror2 (https://docs.magicmirror.builders/) and https://forum.magicmirror.builders/topic/8481/mmm-iframe-ping for video playing. The Raspberry Pi will need to run a full version of Raspbian OS and Node.js. If we were to create a mirror that did detect if you or someone else fell, we would create a config file that allowed to do that. For that to work, we would have to add sensors or a camera that is constantly processing data to recognise the falling motion. These sensors could also be used to detect falling objects. A Microphone for sound detection.

We will also need editors for writing modules in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Although Python is not supported without a node.js wrapper.
<br>
<br>
Skills Required:  
<br> 

Skills required would be basic woodworking skills. One member has a trade-based family, who feels like they could build the base of the mirror with just my experience. The use of already made open-source software for the raspberry does take some time away as well. More skills needed would probably be coding using Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, which we do not have experience using. This would be only if original module software were needed to be made from scratch. It is fairly basic, so a lot of skill is not required for this project.  We would also need to come up with a testing method and how to trouble shoot issues. With only one team member with the physical mirror this may become an issue.
<br>
<br> 
Outcome:  

 

If this project were to become an everyday, every household item, the need for fall detection equipment, like watches, would become unnecessary and the future of connectivity would be accelerated. 223,000 (Injury - Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2021) hospitalised due to unintentional falls, which contributed to 5,100 deaths in the health system (Injury - Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2021) With this device, it could lower these numbers and reduce the number of admissions to aged care homes where many fall victims end up after breaking their hips. Maybe even to zero.
